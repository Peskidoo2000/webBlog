        As local newsrooms across America grapple with dwindling resources and staff shortages, artificial intelligence (AI) i
        s stepping in to help revitalize the industry. AI technologies, like Codeway’s Ask AI, are being leveraged to generate
         accurate, timely, and hyperlocal news content, offering a lifeline to struggling local news outlets.
    </p>
    <p>
        For years, local news in America has faced a crisis. Numerous local papers have downsized or ceased operations, 
        leaving communities without essential coverage. This phenomenon, known as “news deserts,” has left millions of 
        Americans uninformed about local affairs. However, AI offers a solution to this crisis.

    <p>
        So, the top two paragraphs in italics are not my words. They are the way Chat GPT, an AI- powered assistant developed
         by Open AI in partnership with Microsoft, suggested I lead this story after feeding the chatbot this prompt:
          “Write a news story about the way that AI can help solve the crisis in local news in America” 
    </p>
    <p>
        It even offered a headline: “Revolutionizing Local News in America: AI to the Rescue.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, it’s definitely not a headline I would use – a bit too on the nose, lacking wit. And there are a few other 
        problems I have with the chatbot story which I’ll share. But it is definitely not wrong to call what is happening 
        with AI a “revolution,” and at GroundTruth we want to be part of this revolution and make sure that the way this 
        technology is implemented in newsrooms is aligned with the mission and goals of journalism. 
        This week GroundTruth announced a new initiative on AI in local news as part of a collaboration with Microsoft
        to help our Report for America and Report for the World newsrooms find ethical and effective ways to use AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        The “Microsoft On The Issues” blog described the collaboration with GroundTruth and four other organizations as 
        helping newsrooms to “train a new generation of reporters on best uses of AI” and to help “build sustainable 
        newsrooms for generations to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
        There is still a long way to go on figuring out the practical applications for AI in local news.
         There are some interesting experiments around chronicling high school sports and covering municipal government
          meetings and with the sharing of community calendar listings. AI can definitely be a powerful tool for investigative
           reporting and particularly in assessing large data sets. But the truth is no one has cracked the code for local 
           reporting just yet.

        Our Report for America team has conducted an initial needs assessment and reports that there is great interest in 
        learning more about AI among the local newsrooms we partner with across all 50 states. In a sample of newsroom
         managers, 85 percent, or 183 out of 213 respondents, expressed interest in the training workshops that Report for
          America plans to offer this year. A quarter of our partner newsrooms are already using AI in some way and want to
           find out about how to use it more effectively. And about twenty percent are not currently using AI but are 
           exploring ways to get started. It will be exciting to see where this takes us and how local newsrooms across 
           America use AI to serve their communities. We will be following this all closely and will keep you posted in 
           this newsletter.
