        Japanese architect Riken Yamamoto has been named the 2024 Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, 
        an award that is globally seen as architecture’s highest honour.
    <p>
        78-year-old Yamamoto is known for his social advocacy and his built works marrying public and private space, 
        which often make a point of bringing together diverse groups in urban environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        “For me, to recognise space is to recognise an entire community,
        ” Yamamoto said. “We can still honour the freedom of each individual while living together in architecture space
         as a republic, fostering harmony across cultures and phases of life.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Yamamoto defines community as a “sense of sharing one space,” deconstructing traditional notions of freedom and privacy
         and rejecting contemporary ideals that have reduced housing to a commodity and alienated people from their neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
        His career spans five decades and four countries, with a huge variety of projects ranging from private residences 
        to public housing, elementary schools to university buildings, institutions to civic spaces, and city planning.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yamamoto develops a new architectural language that doesn’t merely create spaces for families to live, 
        but creates communities for families to live together,” said Tom Pritzker, Chair of the Hyatt Foundation, 
        which sponsors the award. “His works are always connected to society, cultivating a generosity in spirit and honouring
         the human moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of his most celebrated works include Nagoya Zokei University (Nagoya, Japan, 2022), THE CIRCLE at Zürich Airport
         (Zürich, Switzerland, 2020), Tianjin Library (Tianjin, China, 2012), Jian Wai SOHO (Beijing, China, 2004), Ecoms 
         House (Tosu, Japan, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
        Transparency has been a running theme in Yamamoto’s work, used as a unifying tool so that those inside can experience
         their surroundings while those walking by can feel a sense of belonging.
